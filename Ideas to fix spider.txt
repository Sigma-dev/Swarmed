Ideas to fix spider

TODO:
Try to make the body unaffected by the legs' doing .
    - Just a floating square that keeps n centimeters away from the ground, and the legs just follow as best they can
    - Might be necessary for controlling the AI reliably
    - Might also not be necessary and hurt the realism

Tweak Raycasts position direction length etc...

Tweak stride length etc...

Make a better auto height adjustment to prevent clipping

Give it more possible raycasts to choose target leg position from and choose the best one (closest to optimal distance from body or smth)

--------------------------------------------------

DONE:

Give it the ability to rotate on itself V
Add joint orientation V (Work well to fix legs while climbing walls)
Filter so that the raycasts only take the ground mesh into account V (Implemented with name compare because of gltf limitations, and the name doesn't seem to sync with the updated gltf)
