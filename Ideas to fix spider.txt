Ideas to fix spider

TODO:
Try to make the body unaffected by the legs' doing .
    - Just a floating square that keeps n centimeters away from the ground, and the legs just follow as best they can
    - Might be necessary for controlling the AI reliably
    - Might also not be necessary and hurt the realism

Tweak Raycasts position direction length etc...

Tweak stride length etc...

--------------------------------------------------

DONE:

Give it the ability to rotate on itself V
Add joint orientation V (Work well to fix legs while climbing walls)
Filter so that the raycasts only take the ground mesh into account V (Implemented with name compare because of gltf limitations, and the name doesn't seem to sync with the updated gltf)
