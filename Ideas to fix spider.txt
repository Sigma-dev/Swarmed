Ideas to fix spider

TODO:
Try to make the body unaffected by the legs' doing .
    - Just a floating square that keeps n centimeters away from the ground, and the legs just follow as best they can
    - Might be necessary for controlling the AI reliably

Give it the ability to rotate on itself.
    - The stride is more natural in the forward direction than sideways

--------------------------------------------------

DONE:
Add joint orientation V (Work well to fix legs while climbing walls)
Filter so that the raycasts only take the ground mesh into account V (Implemented with name compare because of gltf limitations, and the name doesn't seem to sync with the updated gltf)
